# Model development.

## Overview.

This notebook trains and evaluates machine learning models for fraud detection and revenue protection. It builds on engineered features and prepares diagnostics that inform deployment planning. The notebook includes model selection, tuning, and interpretability using SHAP, ROC, and PR curves.

## Inputs.

- Engineered feature set from `04_feature_engineering.ipynb`.
- Consolidated dataset prepared in earlier modules.

## Outputs.

- Trained model artifacts.
- SHAP summary plots and feature importance rankings.
- ROC and PR curves for threshold analysis.
- Deployment considerations (tail section).

## Key modules.

- Model selection and training.
- Hyperparameter tuning and validation.
- Interpretability diagnostics using SHAP.
- Threshold optimization using ROC and PR curves.
- Deployment planning (non-executed).

## Stakeholder relevance.

This notebook provides transparency into how fraud detection models are built and evaluated. It supports operational decisions by surfacing interpretable diagnostics and threshold logic. All outputs are annotated for stakeholder clarity.

## Notes.

This notebook does not execute deployment but prepares all necessary diagnostics and planning logic. Deployment execution is deferred to a future module.
